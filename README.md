# Llama's Kitchen!

A project built to _hopefully_ replace the worn binder that holds tattered pages of all the recipes we've collected over the years. Users can view our collection of recipes, complete with sort and search functionality. There are also forms to add your own favorites for us to try.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React, Next.js, MongoDB, TailwindCSS

This was an exciting dive into implementing React into a full-stack application with Next.js. There were _many_ frustrating bugs to work through and a lot of reading documentation, but I persevered and am excited with the outcome. I've still got a few ideas I'd like to work with to be implemented.

## Optimizations

Some optimizations I would implement are:

Add user/auth functionality and implement saving/favoriting recipes
Pagination for the recipes page

## Lessons Learned:

Even though some aspects of this project were frustrating, I absolutely enjoyed the experience I gained through building a web app with this stack. I am grateful for the helpful docs from React and Next.js that helped when I got stuck. As I learn more, I plan to continue adding to the app.
